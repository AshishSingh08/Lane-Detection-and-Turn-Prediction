# Road Lanes Detection and Turn Prediction using Sliding Window Algorithm

It is an implementation of various concepts such as gaussian blurring, image warping, sliding window, and edge detection using the libraries opencv and numpy applied to a real time problem, to detect road lanes and predict upcoming turns.

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to develop a system that can detect road lanes and predict turns in real-time using a sliding window algorithm. To achieve this, we implemented the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: I applied gaussian blurring to reduce noise and image warping to correct for perspective distortion.
2. **Edge Detection**: I used edge detection techniques to identify the edges in the preprocessed image.
3. **Sliding Window**: I used a sliding window algorithm to identify the lane lines in the image by searching for the highest concentration of edges within each window.
4. **Turn Prediction**: I used the positions of the detected lane lines to predict the direction of the turn.

### Objective

The challenge is to not use any inbuilt functions from open source libraries but to implement the mathematics behind the functions and understand how things work behind the API. Once you have implemented both of them compare the result of each technique and validate them with the original dataset.

## Dependencies
